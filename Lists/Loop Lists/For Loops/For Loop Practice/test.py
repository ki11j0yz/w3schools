# after every iteration of i, i becomes something new - so the first iteration prints " * " then it executes the second iteration and the new value for 'i' becomes " ** ". Then on to the 3rd iteration for 'i' and the new value becomes " *** " - and this incrementation continues on for the value of 'rows'.

# i = "*"
# i = "**"
# i = "***"
# i = "****"
# and so on, for whatever the value of 'rows' is.
