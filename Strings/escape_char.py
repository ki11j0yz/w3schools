# to insert illegal characters in a string, use the escape character which is just a '\' (backslash)
# double quotes within a string with double quotes is an example of an illegal character: 
#txt = "We are the so-called "VIKINGS" from the north."

# using the escape character: 
txt = "We are the so-called \"VIKINGS\" form the north."
print(txt)

# OR YOU COULD JUST USE SINGLE QUOTES WITHIN A STRING THAT IS SURROUNDED BY DOUBLE QUOTES
