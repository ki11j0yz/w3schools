# NOTE: information can be passed into functions AS arguments.
# NOTE: args are specified after the function name, inside the parnetheses - you can add as many args as you want, separated by a commma.
 

# example of function w/one arg:
def a_function(fname):
    print(fname + " Chardonnay")

a_function("Tony")
a_function("Carl")
a_function("Paul")


# 'parameter' and 'argument' can be used interchangeably - data that's  passed into a function
# from a function's perspective: a parameter is the variable listed inside the parentheses in the function definition and an argument is the value that is sent to the function when it is called.
